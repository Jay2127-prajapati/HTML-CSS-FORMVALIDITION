Form Validation Project
This project demonstrates a simple form built with HTML and CSS, featuring client-side validation using JavaScript. The form collects user information and validates the inputs to ensure they meet specific requirements before submission.

Features
HTML Structure: The form is structured using semantic HTML for accessibility and readability.
CSS Styling: The form is styled with CSS to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript Validation: JavaScript is used for client-side validation to ensure the form fields meet the required criteria before submission.
Validation Details
The form includes the following validations:

Text Fields: Checks if the fields (e.g., name, address) are not empty and meet character length requirements.
Email Field: Validates if the email address follows a standard email format.
Password Field: Ensures that the password meets minimum requirements, such as length and character types (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
Dropdowns and Checkboxes: Ensures that dropdown options are selected and that checkboxes, if any, are appropriately checked.
Real-time Feedback: Provides instant feedback to the user as they type, indicating which fields need attention.
